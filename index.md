# A Practical Learning Path for Security Analysts

This repository contains a curated, no-fluff learning path for IT professionals moving into a security operations role. The guides are designed to build practical, hands-on skills, moving from core concepts to the day-to-day workflow of a defensive security analyst.

---

## How to Use This Path

The guides are numbered and designed to be followed sequentially. Each one builds on the last, progressively layering more advanced techniques and concepts. There are no shortcuts; mastery of the fundamentals is non-negotiable.
